        I searched for Moo Deng pixel art.
        Why? Pretty much because after finished watching ManlyBadassHero play the demo of SECURITY: The horrible nights, 
        I wondered if anybody had made a sprite sheet for an internet sensation baby hippo yet.
        I then stumbled upon this cute one. 
        To my surprise, even though it was just 4 images, I managed to make sets of animations out of it.
        I really like the dash and flinch actions.
        With the power of Vite and Nuxt, I deployed to this site within the same day.
        What a nice DX ~ I'm just wowed.

        - Convert to a component, so I can use &lt;Moodeng /&gt;
        - Add Thai language because it is more descriptive. If you get what I mean.

        - Add keyboard control, [wsad] [up down left right] ~ Sorry, mobile users

        After this point, there are many things I can do with it. 
        I'm thinking about making Moo Deng dance next. 
        It is suppose to bounce isn't it?
